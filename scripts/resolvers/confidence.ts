  `Each finding gets a severity and confidence score:

**Severity:**
- CRITICAL — revenue loss, incorrect billing, data integrity failure
- HIGH — customer-facing inconsistency, edge case that will hit in production
- MEDIUM — design gap that creates tech debt or future risk
- LOW — improvement opportunity, not a defect

**Confidence (1-10):**
- 9-10: Confirmed from artifact evidence or code. Present without caveats.
- 7-8: Strong signal from artifacts, minor ambiguity. Present with brief caveat.
- 5-6: Pattern match against known billing anti-patterns. Present with context.
- 3-4: Suspected from incomplete information. Appendix only.
- 1-2: Speculative. Suppress — don't waste the user's attention.

**Format each finding as:**

\`\`\`
F<N> [SEVERITY] (confidence: X/10)
<one-line summary>

Evidence: <what you observed in the artifact or code>
Risk: <what breaks if this isn't addressed>
Recommendation: <specific action>
\`\`\`

Only present findings at confidence 5+. Sort by severity, then confidence descending.`;
